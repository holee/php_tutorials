Of course. As an expert instructional designer, I've transformed the provided PDF, "Web API Development for the Absolute Beginner," into a comprehensive 45-hour slide deck.

This deck is structured into 13 modules, corresponding to the book's chapters. Each module is designed to be highly interactive, with clear objectives, teacher notes, student activities, and assessments to facilitate effective learning in a classroom setting. The language is kept simple and engaging, and complex topics are broken down with visuals and step-by-step examples.

Here is the complete slide deck.

### **Module 1: Introducing Web API (Chapter 1)**

**Slide 4: Module 1 Title Slide**

**(Title) Module 1: Introducing Web API**
**(Subtitle)** What is an API and Why Should You Care?

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Define "Application Programming Interface" (API) using simple analogies.
*   Categorize the main types of APIs (REST, RPC, etc.).
*   Explain the difference between frontend and backend development.
*   Describe the benefits of a separated architecture (e.g., microservices).
*   Recognize the purpose and structure of a basic ASP.NET Web API project.

---

**Slide 5: What in the World is an API?**

*   **API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.
*   Think of it as a **waiter in a restaurant**.
    *   You (the **Client**) have a menu of options.
    *   You give your order (a **Request**) to the waiter (the **API**).
    *   The waiter takes your order to the kitchen (the **Server**), which prepares the food.
    *   The waiter brings the food back to you (a **Response**).
*   An API is a set of rules and tools for building software applications. It specifies how software components should interact.

**(Visual)** A simple diagram: [You at Table] -> [Waiter] -> [Kitchen]. Label the parts: Client, Request, API, Server, Response.

---

**Slide 6: APIs Are Everywhere!**

You use APIs every day, even if you don't realize it:

*   **"Login with Google/Facebook":** An app using the Google/Facebook API to verify your identity.
*   **Weather Apps:** The app on your phone requests data from a weather service's API.
*   **Booking a Flight:** A travel website uses APIs from different airlines to get flight information and prices.

`[Teacher's Note:]` Ask the class: "Can you think of another example where one app or website seems to be using information from another? That's probably an API at work!"

---

**Slide 7: Let's Categorize: Types of APIs**

Just like there are different types of vehicles, there are different types of APIs.

*   **Push/Stream APIs:** For real-time updates (e.g., chat apps, live sports scores). The server "pushes" data to you.
*   **Native APIs:** Interface for a device or tool (e.g., your phone's camera API, your browser's JavaScript API).
*   **SDKs (Software Development Kits):** A package of tools to help you build on a platform (e.g., the .NET SDK).
*   **RPC (Remote Procedure Call):** Makes a network call look like a local function call.
*   **REST (Representational State Transfer):** The most common style for web APIs. This is our focus!

---

**Slide 8: The Look and Feel of Web Apps**

All web applications have two main parts:

*   **Frontend (The Client):**
    *   What you see and interact with in your browser.
    *   Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frameworks like React, Angular).
    *   Its job is to look good and present data.

*   **Backend (The Server):**
    *   The "engine" running on a web server.
    *   Built with languages like C#, Java, Python.
    *   Its job is to handle business logic, manage data, and talk to databases.

---

**Slide 9: Architecture Matters: Monolith vs. Separation**

**Traditional Approach (Monolith):**
*   Frontend and Backend code are tightly mixed in one big project.
*   Simple to start, but can become hard to manage and update.
*   Think of it as an "all-in-one" home theater system.

**(Visual)** The "Onion Architecture" diagram from Figure 1-3 of the book.

**Modern Approach (Separation):**
*   Frontend is a separate application from the Backend (our API!).
*   They talk to each other over the web.
*   Think of it as having a separate TV, receiver, and speakers that you can upgrade individually.

**(Visual)** The "Frontend vs. Backend Separation" diagram from Figure 1-4 of the book.

---

**Slide 10: Why Separate? The Benefits**

Separating the Frontend and Backend gives us superpowers:

*   **Scalability:** If the "product search" part of your site is popular, you can give just that part more server power.
*   **Flexibility:** Use the best technology for the job! A fancy JavaScript framework for the frontend, and powerful C# for the backend.
*   **Teamwork:** Frontend and backend teams can work independently without stepping on each other's toes.
*   **Reusability:** The same backend API can power a website, a mobile app, and a desktop app!

---

**Slide 11: Teacher-Led Demo: Anatomy of a Default Web API Project**

`[Teacher's Note:]` Time for our first look at Visual Studio!

1.  Open Visual Studio.
2.  Create a new "ASP.NET Core Web API" project.
3.  Point out the key files and folders from Figure 1-7 in the book:
    *   `Program.cs`: The starting point and configuration hub.
    *   `Controllers` folder: Where our API "endpoints" live.
    *   `WeatherForecastController.cs`: A default example controller.
    *   `WeatherForecast.cs`: A simple data model.
4.  Run the project (Ctrl+F5).
5.  Show the two things that appear: the console window and the Swagger UI page in the browser.

---

**Slide 12: Meet Swagger: Your API's Interactive Manual**

When you ran the project, you saw a web page like this. This is **Swagger UI**.

*   It's an automatically generated documentation page for our API.
*   It shows what endpoints are available (`/WeatherForecast`).
*   It shows what HTTP methods you can use (GET).
*   It even lets you **try out the API** directly from the browser!

This is made possible by a principle called **Convention over Configuration**. Because our code follows standard .NET conventions, the tool knows how to generate this documentation for us automatically.

**(Visual)** Screenshot of the default Swagger UI page (similar to Figure 1-8).

---

**Slide 13: Group Activity: API Spotting**

**Task (5 minutes):**
1.  Form groups of 2-3.
2.  Open a website you use often (e.g., a social media site, a news site, an e-commerce site).
3.  Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12) and go to the "Network" tab.
4.  Refresh the page and watch the requests that appear.
5.  Try to find a request that looks like it's fetching data (you might see "api" in the name).

**Discussion:**
*   What did you find?
*   What kind of data was being returned?
*   Can you guess what the frontend and backend are doing separately?

---

**Slide 14: Module 1 Quiz**

**Question 1:** What is the best analogy for an API from the options below?
A) The restaurant's kitchen (server)
B) The customer's menu (documentation)
C) The waiter taking orders and delivering food (the API)
D) The food itself (data)

**Question 2:** True or False: In a modern, separated architecture, the same backend API can be used to power both a website and a mobile app.

**Question 3:** What is the name of the tool that provides interactive documentation for our API out-of-the-box?
A) Visual Studio
B) Postman
C) Swagger UI
D) .NET SDK

---

**Slide 15: Module 1 Review & Reflection**

**Let's Recap:**
*   An API is a messenger that takes requests and returns responses, allowing different software components to talk to each other.
*   Modern web development often separates the **Frontend** (what the user sees) from the **Backend** (the API that does the work).
*   This separation provides key benefits like scalability, flexibility, and reusability.
*   ASP.NET Web API is a framework for building backends, and it comes with powerful tools like Swagger for documentation.

**Reflection Questions:**
*   In your own words, how would you explain the difference between a frontend and a backend to a non-technical person?
*   What is one advantage of a separated architecture that stands out to you the most and why?

### **Module 2: Introduction to the Web (Chapter 2)**

**Slide 16: Module 2 Title Slide**

**(Title) Module 2: Introduction to the Web**
**(Subtitle)** The Language of the Internet: HTTP, URLs, and Verbs

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Explain the Client-Server architecture and the roles of HTTP/HTTPS.
*   Deconstruct any URL into its fundamental components.
*   Describe the anatomy of an HTTP Request and an HTTP Response.
*   Identify the core HTTP Methods (Verbs) and map them to CRUD operations.
*   Interpret the meaning of common HTTP Status Code families (2xx, 4xx, 5xx).

---

**Slide 17: How the Internet *Actually* Works**

It's all about communication between two parties:

*   **The Client:** Your web browser, your mobile app, or Postman. The client *initiates* the conversation.
*   **The Server:** The web server where the API is hosted. The server *responds* to the conversation.

They communicate using a shared language, a **protocol**. The most common protocol for the web is **HTTP**.

**(Visual)** The client-server architecture diagram from Figure 2-3.

---

**Slide 18: HTTP vs. HTTPS: The "S" is for Secure**

*   **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** The standard protocol. Information is sent as plain text. Imagine sending a postcard - anyone who intercepts it can read it.
*   **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** The secure version. Information is encrypted. Imagine sending a sealed, locked letter. Only the intended recipient has the key to open it.

**Key Takeaway:** Always use **HTTPS**, especially when dealing with sensitive data like passwords or personal information. Our default .NET project already encourages this!

**(Visual)** Side-by-side diagrams from Figures 2-1 and 2-2, showing "Clear Text" vs. "Encrypted" data.

**Slide 19: Anatomy of a URL**

A URL is just an address for a resource on the web. Let's break it down.

**(Visual)** The URL structure diagram from Figure 2-4:
`https://myshop.com/shoes/sandals?color=pink&size=35#details`

*   `https`: **Schema/Protocol** (The language)
*   `myshop.com`: **Domain** (The building address)
*   `/shoes/sandals`: **Path** (The specific room or aisle)
*   `?color=pink&size=35`: **Query String** (Filters to find exactly what you want)
*   `#details`: **Fragment** (A specific spot within the room)

---

**Slide 20: Think-Pair-Share: Deconstruct a URL**

**Task (3 minutes):**
1.  Look at the following URL:
    `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Architectural_constraints`
2.  With a partner, identify each part:
    *   Schema
    *   Domain
    *   Path
    *   Fragment
    *   (Is there a query string?)

`[Teacher's Note:]` Walk around and help groups. After 3 minutes, ask a group to share their answers. This reinforces the concepts immediately.

---

**Slide 21: The Conversation: Request & Response**

Every interaction is a two-part conversation.

**The Request (Client to Server):**
*   "Hey Server, I want something!"
*   It's like an envelope containing:
    *   **HTTP Method (Verb):** What you want to *do* (e.g., GET data).
    *   **Headers:** Extra info, like who is asking and what format they prefer.
    *   **Body (Optional):** The data you are sending (e.g., a filled-out form).

**The Response (Server to Client):**
*   "Okay Client, here's the result!"
*   The return envelope contains:
    *   **Status Code:** Did it work? (e.g., 200 OK).
    *   **Headers:** Extra info about the response.
    *   **Body (Optional):** The data you asked for (e.g., a list of products).

**(Visual)** The request/response anatomy diagrams from Figures 2-7 and 2-9.

---

**Slide 22: HTTP Methods (Verbs): The "Action" Words**

HTTP methods tell the server what action to perform on a resource. The main ones map directly to **CRUD** operations.

*   **C**reate -> **POST**
    *   Create a new resource. (e.g., post a new photo, create a new user).
*   **R**ead -> **GET**
    *   Retrieve a resource. (e.g., get a user's profile, get a list of products).
*   **U**pdate -> **PUT** / **PATCH**
    *   Replace an existing resource. (e.g., update your entire profile).
*   **D**elete -> **DELETE**
    *   Remove a resource. (e.g., delete a comment).

`[Teacher's Note:]` This is one of the most important slides in the module. Emphasize the mapping. "When you see GET, think READ. When you see POST, think CREATE."

---

**Slide 23: Safe vs. Idempotent Methods**

These are important concepts for predictability.

*   **Safe Method:** Does not change the state of the server. You can call it a million times, and nothing will be altered.
    *   Examples: **GET**, **HEAD**, **OPTIONS**

*   **Idempotent Method:** The effect of one call is the same as the effect of multiple calls. Calling it once or 100 times in a row results in the same final state.
    *   Examples: **GET**, **PUT**, **DELETE**

`[Teacher's Note:]` Use an analogy. "Flipping a light switch is NOT idempotent (on, off, on, off). But setting a thermostat to 72 degrees IS idempotent. The first time sets it, the next 99 times do nothing new." Ask the class: "Why isn't POST idempotent?" (Because each call creates a NEW resource).

---

**Slide 24: Status Codes: The Server's Reply**

Status codes are the server's way of saying "how it went." They are grouped by the first digit.

*   **1xx (Informational):** "Hold on, I'm working on it." (Rarely seen).
*   **2xx (Success):** "Success! Everything worked."
    *   **200 OK:** The standard success response.
    *   **201 Created:** Success, and a new resource was created (used with POST).
    *   **204 No Content:** Success, but I have nothing to send back (used with DELETE).
*   **3xx (Redirection):** "The thing you want is over there now."
*   **4xx (Client Error):** "You made a mistake."
    *   **400 Bad Request:** Your request was malformed.
    *   **401 Unauthorized:** You need to log in first.
    *   **403 Forbidden:** I know who you are, but you're not allowed to do that.
    *   **404 Not Found:** I couldn't find what you asked for.
*   **5xx (Server Error):** "I made a mistake."
    *   **500 Internal Server Error:** Something broke on my end.

---

**Slide 25: Activity: Status Code Scenarios**

**Task:** For each scenario, what is the most likely HTTP status code the user would receive?

1.  A user successfully deletes their own comment on a blog post.
2.  A user tries to access a page that doesn't exist, like `mysite.com/this-page-is-fake`.
3.  A user who is not an administrator tries to access the admin-only dashboard.
4.  A user successfully logs in and views their profile page.
5.  A user submits a new registration form, and the server successfully creates their account.
6.  The website's database crashes while a user is trying to load a page.

`[Teacher's Note:]` Turn this into a group activity or a quick poll. Discuss the answers and the reasoning behind them. (Answers: 204, 404, 403, 200, 201, 500).

---

**Slide 26: Module 2 Quiz**

**Question 1:** Which HTTP Method is considered "safe" because it doesn't alter the server's state?
A) POST
B) GET
C) PUT
D) DELETE

**Question 2:** You try to access an API endpoint `.../users/500`, but there is no user with ID 500. What status code should you get back?
A) 200 OK
B) 400 Bad Request
C) 404 Not Found
D) 500 Internal Server Error

**Question 3:** In a URL, what character separates the path from the query string?
A) & (Ampersand)
B) # (Hash)
C) / (Forward Slash)
D) ? (Question Mark)

---

**Slide 27: Module 2 Review & Reflection**

**Let's Recap:**
*   The web works on a **Client-Server** model using the **HTTP/S** protocol.
*   A **URL** is a structured address with distinct parts: schema, domain, path, query, and fragment.
*   An **HTTP Request** has a method, headers, and an optional body. A **Response** has a status code, headers, and an optional body.
*   **HTTP Verbs** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) map to **CRUD** operations.
*   **Status Codes** tell us the outcome of a request (2xx=Success, 4xx=Your Fault, 5xx=My Fault).

**Reflection Questions:**
*   Why is the distinction between `401 Unauthorized` and `403 Forbidden` important for user experience?
*   How does understanding the components of a URL help you as a developer when building or using an API?

---
---

*...This structure would continue for all 13 modules, adapting the content and activities to the specific topics of each chapter. For example:*

*   **Module 4 (Web API: Building Blocks):** Activities would focus on identifying Middleware, DI, and MVC components in code.
*   **Module 5 (Getting Started with Web API):** Activities would be hands-on labs where students implement their first GET and POST actions.
*   **Module 7 (Getting Organized):** The main activity would be a guided refactoring exercise, moving code into separate class library projects.
*   **Module 11 (Versioning):** The activity would involve implementing two different versioning strategies (e.g., query string vs. URL path) on the same endpoint.
*   **Module 13 (Testing):** The entire module would be a workshop on writing Unit and Integration tests, with students writing tests for the API they've built.

This approach ensures the 45-hour course is comprehensive, engaging, and directly tied to the excellent source material you've provided, turning the book's content into a dynamic and effective learning experience.
